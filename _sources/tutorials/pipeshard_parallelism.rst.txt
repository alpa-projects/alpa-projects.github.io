Distributed Training with Both Shard and Pipeline Parallelism
=============================================================

Alpa can automatically parallelizes jax functions with both shard
parallelism (a.k.a. intra-operator parallelism) and pipeline parallelism
(a.k.a. inter-operator parallelism). Shard parallelism includes
data parallelism, operator parallelism, and their combinations.
The :ref:`quick start <Alpa Quickstart>` focuses on using Alpa for shard parallelism.

In this tutorial, we show how to use Alpa with both shard and pipeline parallelism.
First, we show how to use Alpa to manually assign stages for pipeline parallelism.
Then we show how to use Alpa to automate this process.

the cluster and disributed workers. We initialize ray and alpa.

Train an MLP on a Single Device
-------------------------------
In this tutorial, we use a toy dataset to train an MLP model.
Specifically, we use the model to fit the function: :math:`y = Wx + b`.
Note that now this model is being executed on CPU because we force the driver
process to use the CPU.

Pipeline Parallelism with Manual Assignment
-------------------------------------------
To manually assign stages for pipeline parallelism, we can use the
``alpa.mark_pipeline_boundary`` function to mark the boundary of each pipeline
stage, and use the ``@alpa.manual_layer_construction`` decorator to indicate
that we are manually assigning stages. Note that each the pipeline stage is
also automatically parallelized by the shard parallel pass.

Pipeline Parallelism with Automatic Assignment
----------------------------------------------
Alpa also supports automatically partitioning the model into multiple
pipeline stages and assign each pipeline stage a device mesh such that
the total execution latency is minimized. Specifically, the automatic
partitioning algorithm consists of the following steps:

1. **Layer Construction:** In this step, the operators in the model are
   clustered into "layers" based on a graph clustering algorithm. The
   user needs to specify the total number of layers (i.e. clusters) as
   a hyperparameter.
2. **Stage Construction and Mesh Slicing:** In this step, we partition
   the device cluster (device mesh) to multiple submeshes and assign
   layers to submeshes to form pipeline stages to minimize the total
   pipeline execution latency.
